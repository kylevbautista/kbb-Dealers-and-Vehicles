# Cox coding exercise

Simple React app that displays Dealer and Vehicle data being fetched, and
displays the amount of time it took to create and post the answer to endpoint.

### Note:

Using React, I noticed retrieving and posting is about 1 second slower. Elapsed Time around 9.5 seconds. <br>
Pure JS and running on Node.js is about 1 second faster. Elapsed Time around 8.5 seconds <br>
Both however,are significantly under 30 seconds.
